notes for how to run the chat server , 
1. on a kali linux machine "for example" install node.js that hosts websites ,use this command
   - sudo apt install node.js npm (for linux)
   - install node.js tool https://nodejs.org/ (for win 10)
2. and how to run the server , "after navigating to the folder"
   - node server.js (on linux)
   - node server.js (on win 10)
3. how to open the chat ? , 1st you need to now you ip address "the local one don't be dummy ;)"     for example it would be 192.168.0.11 and the port we host the server on is 8000 so ,
       just write http://localhost:8000 and the "localhost" you need to know to give it to the            other person in the same network so you give him that link FE , http://192.168.0.10:8000
          not "localhost" ;cause it won't open the chat for any user "except you " .

   
     and that's it if you have any issue contact me to develop this tool .
